# Readme for Docker related files

In this folder, I've added all Docker/Kubernetes related files.

**Important note:** Don't forget to add a `.env.dev` file with following content:
```txt
PASSWORD=SomePasswordHere
```

## Docker-Compose files

- docker-compose.dev.yaml: this file is used to start a local development environment.
- docker-compose.yaml: this file will start the whole application

## kube Files
All files, needed to host this app in Kubernetes are located in the kube folder.
